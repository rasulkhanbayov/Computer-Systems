Here you will learn how to basic html codes, unix commands , shell scripting, powershell scripting.

Lectures

The lecture focuses on the following ideas:

-> Get to know the bases of the computer architecture.

-> Be able to make a difference between the most important computer systems (microcontrollers, system with several processors, systems with several cores, data, programs, implementation)

-> Know the base building elements of a computer (motherboard, processor (Cisc,Risc), memory, input/output periferies)

-> Know the different logical and physical levels of computer building elements (CPU memory, I/O â€“ motherboard, processor, memory, videocard /

-> Have a clear understanding of the working mechanism of the base building computer elements (instruction, operating, memory handling, cache memory, cache, interrupt, DMA)

-> Get to know the main commands and possibilities of the operating systems

-> Be aware of the idea of computer programs and the tools to create one.

-> Know the idea of the file systems, it's structure, role, some base types!

-> Be able to make a difference between the tasks of a user and a system administrator, to know the main elements of them.

-> Know the fundamentals of connecting a computer to a network(local network-LAN, switch, router, etc.)

-> Be able to write base script programs on Linux and on Windows platforms.

-> Understand that script programs are the best friend for users and administrators as well!



Practice
Practices are dealing with:

-> Know the base elements of computers, for example changing a desktop processor!

-> Know and use the base commands of UNIX and Windows systems and their possibilities.

-> Be able to use the command line and the graphical interface of an operating system

-> Use the editor adequate for the purpose (vi, joe, pico, notepad, )

-> Know the base filter commands ( wc, cut, grep, sed, awk, etc.), useful commands (tar, zip, unzip, find, etc.)

-> Know the base possibilities of a computer connected to the network (browser, mail, telnet, ssh, scp, putty, winscp, ping, traceroute etc.)

-> Be able to write command files under Linux and Windows operating systems (variable, parameter, branch, cycle), to use regular expressions

-> Know the bases of Powershell, the structure and usage of PS commands

-> Be able to write base PowerShell scripts (variable, parameter, branch, cycle, function)
